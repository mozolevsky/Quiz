                    "When we discover our dosha, we learn where and how these forces move and accumulate, which leads us to understand how health or disease manifests in our body and psychology. By bringing awareness to our state of being, we learn about the strengths and weaknesses in our constitution, e.g. those places unique to us which require more attention in order to remain in balance.",
                    "When we speak about the doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, we are talking about the natural elements and their qualities of being: ether (space), air, fire, water, and earth. In their combinations, each participates in the construction of individual bodies and personalities. As each element has its own temperament and attribute to contribute, this leads to a certain tendency of expression within you.",
                    "Vata is brittle, airy, cold, prone roughness, wrinkling, and dryness: like a tree in the winter. It’s windy, and forces other things to move. You are slender, sensitive to chill, and suffer from dry or rough skin conditions, and irregular digestion or appetite. You are an imaginative, creative, quick thinking type of person. You love experiencing new things, ideas, people, and places. You grasp new concepts with vigor, but have a hard time holding onto them; maybe even your keys or other easily misplaced items. You experience bursts of energy and tend to walk and talk fast. You’re always on the go and often find the only way you feel productive is if you’re doing something all the time, but then wonder why you suddenly feel so tired.",
                    "Being ruled by air, music and sounds move you into, or out of, balance. The big city life and the sounds of the world on the go can feel cacophonous and jarring to your more delicate sensibilities. You are emotionally sensitive, and find urself moved to tears by feelings of beauty, grief, and gratitude. Your mind is always working.",
                    "As a Vata, you, more than any other dosha have the potential to successfully lead a very spiritual life, because of the association with ether - the principle spiritual substance in manifestation. If this is not an important part of your life yet, it might be worth considering.",

                    "Vatas are also prone to feeling misunderstood, and you often are. Perhaps you recognize within yourself the personal experience that you feel different than your peers, or don’t belong, etc.",
                    "As a note of both validation and caution: one of the worst things you can do is take it upon yourself to try and be and desire what you see others wanting and expressing as their sense of self: this will only deplete and imbalance you. You can’t try and be part of the crowd, you have to forge your own path.",

                    "We recommend making a tiny space to spend an hour each day. We know this seems impossible for most people in their busy lives, but for YOU, it is essential you make it a point to “recharge”. This will support you to avoid becoming overwhelmed or anxious. If you have spiritual aspirations, this will preserve your vital energies.",
                    "You need time to transition, and you need time outs. Choose activities that uplift your heart: this is your key to the universe. Choose meditation. Try a restorative vinyasa class instead. It’s ok to know and admit you need rest, grounding, and slowness. You tend to be go-go-go like the wind, and you need to add some earth and water and warmth into your life on a regular basis. As much as you might hate and reject it with every cell of your being: routine is  very good and stabilizing for you",
                    "When stressed, you tend to self-medicate with sugar, as the sweet taste feels nourishing and brings a sense of relief, but you’re setting yourself up for a roller coaster if you don’t make it a point to support your constitutional needs. A blood sugar rise will only exacerbate your tendency to over-extend yourself when you actually need rest.The resulting crashes and out of control. Insomnia is common under these conditions, as well as a tendency to forget to eat, and weight loss."

Now, choosing sweet does not mean having a free-for-all with overt sugars: complex-carbohydrates and healthy fats will work with you to help calm your mind. Choose warm over cold, and moist or unctuous instead of dry and plain: seek out cooked grains with a swirl of ghee or olive oil, soups, warming herbs, and stewed fruits. Make sure you drink plenty of water, warm is best. It’s important for your digestion and energy to stay hydrated, and well lubricated. As Vata dominates in the Winter, be  articularly mindful about staying balanced during the cold, dry months ofthe year.",

This is the number one way to balance kapha’s lymph-y tendencies and the fact that it’s far too easy for you to gain unwanted pounds.
