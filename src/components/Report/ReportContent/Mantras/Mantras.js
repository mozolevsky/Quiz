                <p> In the Vedic philosophy, creation is dependent on light and sound, thus a mantra is a word, phrase, or sound root  that is used to create a certain vibration within your physiology. By using these spiritual roots, phrases, and sounds, you invite the mind to operate in a deeper, subtler way. It can be life changing as a regular practice.</p>

                <p>As a Kapha, you already benefit from a calmer, serene quality to your mind; but if youâ€™re unbalanced, you may trend towards depression and possessiveness. In this case, you need regular opportunities cultivate joy and energy. So we want to recommend a mantra that not only uplifts, but purifies and cleanses the psychophysiology. </p>

                <p>One of the very best prayers and phrases for you to contemplate is as follows:</p>

                <Quote txt={mantrasQuote} short={true}/>

                <p>Another one is So-Hum (inhale on so, exhale on hum).</p>

                <ContinueBtn link="/report/gems" txt="Recommended Gems"/>
           </div>
